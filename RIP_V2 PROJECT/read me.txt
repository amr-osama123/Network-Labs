(RIP v2 – Part 1) 🔥
🔹 Networking from Zero – Practical Labs | RIP v2 (Part 1)

Many beginners learn routing protocols theoretically, but real understanding comes from hands-on practice.

In this lab, I implemented RIP v2 dynamic routing to enable communication between multiple networks using Cisco Packet Tracer.

🧠 Lab Objective

Demonstrate RIP v2 dynamic routing between multiple networks and verify end-to-end connectivity.

🔧 What’s implemented:

RIP version 2

no auto-summary

Multiple LAN networks with different subnet sizes

/30 point-to-point link between routers

Full end-to-end ping verification

✅ Result:

All networks successfully communicate with each other, and ping works end-to-end across the entire topology.

🔸 اللاب ده بيشرح بروتوكول RIP v2 بطريقة بسيطة وتطبيق عملي، وبيوضح إزاي الشبكات المختلفة تقدر تتواصل باستخدام Dynamic Routing.
